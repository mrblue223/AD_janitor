# 🛡️ Enhanced AD Janitor & Security Dashboard

## Project Overview

This toolset is an integrated solution for **Active Directory (AD) Security Assessment and Visualization**. It is designed to perform deep domain enumeration, identify critical vulnerabilities, and provide an interactive web dashboard for security analysis and prioritized remediation.

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `AD_janitor.py` | The core console utility. Connects to the Domain Controller (DC) to enumerate users, groups, and computers, scanning for high-impact misconfigurations like AS-REP Roasting, Kerberoasting, and Unconstrained Delegation. Outputs findings to a CSV file. |
| `ad.viz.py` | A Streamlit application that transforms the raw CSV findings into a dynamic, filterable web-based security dashboard. |
| `ad.csv` | A sample output file demonstrating the structure of security findings generated by `AD_janitor.py`. |
